# squares
simple game of capture.  Rules are evolving


Squares is a game that utilizes a blank 25 x 18 game board. 
Players take turns clicking on the game board placing pieces.  
When a player has a piece that is "jumped" that piece is captured and turned over to the other player.
Play continues until there are no more moves or the gameboard is full.
